<p>I am a 9th grader who go's to everst high school. who is a huge nerd for nintendo games and products. I am a huge sucker for sci-fi awsomeness. I live in the califonia of the usa. My favorite movie is avengers age of ultron. The reason i like was because of the action sequences as well as the plot of the story. One of my hoddies is recording and editing youtube videos. The reason i like to make youtube videos is ,because i like to make people rough day a lot better by just watching my videos and enjoy them.The reason that i got into youtubing is ,because a youtuber that i really enjoy watching told his life story that really touched me and then from that day fourth i started making content for my youtube channel that is still up today.  </p>
