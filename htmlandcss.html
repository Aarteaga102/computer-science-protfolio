<h2>Html what is it?</h2>
<p>Html stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Html is used to make websites like this websites you are on right now, and other websites like youtube. 
</p>
<h2>Who made html?</h2>
<p>
    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, who was a contractor at CERN and helped to create the first dating site in 1995, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first. As stated by wikipedia.

<h2>How do you write html?</h2>
<p>
   There are many ways of writing html. The main way of writing html is just put one less than and greater than sign and putting the command or a tag(a tag is what we call a command in html.) in the signs. Then at the end of the command you also put a slash in the signs but before the command name.

<h2>What is Css?</h2>
<p>
    
    Css stand for Cascading Style Sheet and is used by web pages to help keep information in the proper display format.
</p>
<h2>How is Css used?</h2>
<p>
    Css is used in html as a kind of add on launguage to html with a catch you have to make a style command it is done the same way that any you make commands. With css you can make your website look a lot better by add cool little things.

<h2>Who made Css</h2>
<p>CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside W3C resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.
Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, allowed a document's style to be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading".
As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).
Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995. Around this time the W3C was already being established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996 Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS). The spec was never finished and is deprecated. By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December. As stated by wikipedia

<h2>How do you write Css?</h2>
<p>
The way you would code css is pretty much the same way you would code javascript more or less like this stuff{ color:red;}
</p>
<h2>How do you write a tag?</h2>
<p>You wirte a tag the same way you make a command.</p>
<h2>What are attributes and how do you change them?</h2>
<p>
Arrributes are when you add an extra thing in the tag. you can change attributes by change what they do.
</p>
<h2>Four examples of diffrent tags!</h2>
<p>One tag that is used quite a lot id the p tag that makes paragraphs. Another tag that is widly used is the h tags </p>
