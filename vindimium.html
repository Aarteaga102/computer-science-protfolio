    <h3>What is Vindinium?</h3>
    <p>vindinium is a website that allows you to code a "bot". this bot or AI which ever you prefer, moves and does stuff in this game world that every simlair lay out as chest but very different. You code this bot however you want it , but if you make it go into the online arenas you may be overwhelmed if not coded correctly or crash.</p>
    
    
    <h3>How is this gamed played and how do you win?</h3>
    <p>The way it is played is one you get a code from the website. Be prepapred to write this code down because if you forget it or lose it thats it you would have to make a new account. Once you have done that get the starter files and download it to a code editer. For us we did it on c9.io. Then mess around with the code. you have to files to work in one is the test file that you use in training to see if your bot functions. The other file is the stable file which you us in the arena or online battles. The way you win the game is by having the most gold,but there are chanllenges along the way to the top. First off if your bot doesn't move and stays still for long periods of time then it will gradually lose health over time. Two if you get killed by another player then you spawn back but the person who killed you gets all you mines. Three if you lose heath each time you capture a mine, and you csn die from capturing to many mines with out healing. If that happens then you lose all your minnes and then they be come open again. four the way you heal is by taverns , but you have to pay for each time you heal so don't over us it when you only have one mine. Five other players have been know to take over other players mines so make sure your bots and take back its mines. </p>

    <h3>What does all this code mean.</h3>
    <p> Well first lets start at the top and then work are way down to the bottem. The first part is all about the bots variables and its way to getting into the arena and training. </p>
    <p>The next part is the bots variables, such as how it will find other bots and the the other bots position. </p>
    <p> The next set of code is all about the functions that it has. For one the find and capturing free mines. how it does tjis is by find the position of the nearest mine and then goes to it and captures it.  </p>
    <p>The next set of code is for get enemy mines because if the map is small everybody wil have captured one mine so what would it do if there are no free mines. Well thats were this code comes into play.what it does is the same thing as capturing a free mine but thats already taken.</p>
    <p>The next set of code is for taverns which is the place to heal up and get your life points back. They way it finds taverns is the same process as finding a mine.</p>
    <p>The next set of code is for killing other bots. The way this code is setup to kill the bot who has the most mines. The way it doe sthis is by using if statements to see who ha sthe most mines and if you have the right amount of health to do the killing. So it will chase after them till he has killed the bot with the most mines.</p>
    <p>The last and final set of is a bit confusing to understand but i will explain it. it say if my bots life is at 52 hp then it will find a path to the closest Tavern. else if its life is ay 72 hp then it will go after mines near it. else if another bots health is less the 32 and is near it it wil attack it, and if all of this don't happens then just go after any mines. </p>
